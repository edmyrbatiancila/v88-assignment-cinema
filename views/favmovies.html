                                <p class="card-text">Based on a novel with the same name by Olivia Newman. Best movie for me, because of it's unique story telling about the
                                girl who live independently but still seeking for love and kindness to other people. There is a plot wist at the end of
                                the movies that blown my mind. Most recommended movie for those introvert people like me. üòÅüòÄüòÅ</p>
